# Duke Data Service Clients

This repository is designed to provide example client consumers of the [Duke
Data Service API](https://api.dataservice.duke.edu/apiexplorer) written in a
variety of programming languages. These are not meant to make exhaustive use
of the API. They are meant as examples to use to get started developing your
own DDS clients.
